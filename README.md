# Pokèpwn: A script for automating Pokèmon Showdown

## What is this?
My solution for Pokèseek, a competition hosted by ARIES, IITD where the task was to make the best Pokèmon Showdown bot.
This is a rule based solution that really only handles the situation within the constraints of the challenge. For a more robust approach, try [pmariglia/foul-play](https://github.com/pmariglia/foul-play) (uses MCTS) or reinforcement learning.

## How to Run?
Clone the original server code
```
git clone https://github.com/Aries-IITD/Tryst-RL-Codebase
```

Then copy paste all files here in the client folder (replace existing files)
After that install both client and server dependencies with

```
cd client
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd ../server
npm i
```

And then just run the server and driver as per the instructions in the orignal repo linked above (Aries-IITD/Tryst-RL-Codebase)

## Why did you even post this?
I'll keep making better versions and it would be useful to be able to compare them all.
